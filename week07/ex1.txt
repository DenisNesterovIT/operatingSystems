Throughput for first fit algorithm is - 0.029412.
Throughput for best fit algorithm is - 0.000041.
Throughput for worst fit algorithm is - 0.000040.
Throughput of best fit and worst are approximately equal, because fo finding necessary memory block the should go through all memory.
Throughput of first fit algorithm is the most, because time for allocarting is less, but for memory usage best fot algorithm is better.
